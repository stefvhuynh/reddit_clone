Reddit Clone
============

This is a light clone of [Reddit](https://reddit.com). Users and create subreddits 
and post in them. Users can also comment on posts and upvote both posts and comments. 
The most upvoted items appear on top. The coolest feature of this project is nested 
comments. Just like on Reddit, users can comment on other comments. This required
I recursively call a partial, which I thought was pretty cool at the time.
